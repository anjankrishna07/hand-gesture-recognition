With code, we are providing the saved model to evaluate the model

To evaluate the model

1. run the run.ipynb file you will get the accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score of the model, it will take 2-3 minutes to run

there is a cell where we try to integrate model with camera in run.ipynb

we also provided the other models that we tried to run, just to show the effort that we put into this project.

In the main file coding.ipynb doesn't run the file, since it starts training again and all the weights get changed it also takes a lot of time

description of coding file

leapgestrecog-preprocessed dataset
coding.ipynb-main code
run.ipynb - code to evaluate the model
model.pth - weight file to evaluate model
preprocessing.ipynb - code for creating the main sub directories
OTHER_MODELS_NOT_PART_OF_MAIN_CODE - this folder contains vgg16 and resnet10 models that we tried to run, just put them as reference that we tried other models too, but alexnet suited to our computational resources
